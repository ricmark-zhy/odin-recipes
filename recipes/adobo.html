    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken Adobo is a classic Filipino dish that combines tender chicken pieces simmered in a savory mix of soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, and bay leaves. <br>The balance of salty, tangy, and slightly sweet flavors makes it a comfort food favorite across the Philippines.</p>
    <p>This dish is incredibly versatile — it can be served with steamed rice, fried rice, or even enjoyed cold the next day. <br>Cooking it slowly allows the chicken to absorb the rich sauce, resulting in a tender and flavorful meal that’s perfect for family dinners or casual meals.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul style="width: 500px;">
        <li>2 tablespoons neutral oil</li>
        <li>5 chicken drumsticks</li>
        <li>5 bone-in chicken thighs</li>
        <li>1 large yellow onion, quartered and sliced 1/4 inch thick</li>
        <li>8 cloves garlic, smashed</li>
        <li>5 bay leaves</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon whole black peppercorns</li>
        <li>1 cup cane vinegar (see Tips) or unseasoned rice vinegar</li>
        <li>⅓ cup reduced-sodium soy sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol style="width: 500px;">
        <li>
            Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large pot over medium heat until it starts to shimmer.<br>
            Add 5 drumsticks and cook until brown on all sides, 4 to 6 minutes. <br>
            Transfer to a plate. Add 5 thighs to the pot and cook until browned, about 3 minutes per side. <br>
            Transfer to the plate with the drumsticks.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add 1 onion, 8 garlic cloves, 5 bay leaves and 1/4 teaspoon peppercorns to the pot; cook, stirring occasionally, until the garlic just begins to brown, about 3 minutes. <br>
            Add 1 cup vinegar and 1/3 cup soy sauce and bring to a simmer, scraping up any browned bits. <br>
            Return the chicken to the pot and turn to coat with the sauce. Reduce heat to maintain a gentle simmer, cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is very tender, about 1 hour.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer the chicken to a clean plate and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. <br>
            Bring the sauce to a boil and cook, stirring often, until reduced by about one-third, 3 to 5 minutes. <br>
            Serve the chicken with the sauce.
        </li>
    </ol>
